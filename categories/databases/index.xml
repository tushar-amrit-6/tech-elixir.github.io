      <description>Last week, I had a good conversation with a CEO of a tech start-up based in Tel Aviv. The conversation revolved around the use of foriegn data wrapper in PostgreSQL for caching frequent queries, incremental materialized views for large databases and Change Data Capture(CDC) for eventual consistency in incremental materialized views. So yeah, writing this article on the most common use of CDC which is designing event driven architecture. This was a topic I had been eagerly waiting to explore ever since I first came across Debezium, which now has became the de facto standard for CDC.</description>

      <title>What&#39;s up with DuckDBü¶Ü</title>

      <description>I was exploring the vector database world after my day job when I came across ChromaDB which recently raised a seed funding of 20 mils üí∏. Digging deep into chroma led me to DuckDB as these mfs at Chroma are selling a wrapper on an already matured OLAP DB (DuckDB) with hnswlib. Just for context, hnswlib is a C++/Python library for fast calculation of approximate nearest neighbors (ANN). I&amp;rsquo;ll take more about vector DBs some other day when I&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully use it in my side project.</description>
