The conversation revolved around the use of foriegn data wrapper in PostgreSQL for caching frequent queries, incremental materialized views for large databases and Change Data Capture(CDC) for eventual consistency in incremental materialized views. So yeah, writing this article on the most common use of CDC which is designing event driven architecture. This was a topic I had been eagerly waiting to explore ever since I first came across Debezium, which now has became the de facto standard for CDC.\nWhat is Change Data Capture? CDC is a technique used in databases and data management systems to identify and track changes made to data within a database. It‚Äôs especially valuable in scenarios where you need to keep track of and replicate changes made to a database in near real-time, such as for data warehousing, data integration, and synchronization purposes.\nHere‚Äôs how CDC typically works:   Capture Changes: CDC systems continuously monitor the source database for any changes, such as inserts, updates, or deletes, to the data.\n  Identify and Record Changes: When a change is detected, CDC systems capture and record information about the change, including the specific data that was modified, the type of operation (insert, update, delete), and a timestamp indicating when the change occurred.\n  Store Change Data: The captured change data is usually stored in a dedicated CDC repository or log, separate from the source database. This allows for efficient querying and retrieval of change information.\n  Replication and Analysis: CDC systems can then replicate these changes to target databases, data warehouses, or other systems as needed. This ensures that downstream systems have access to the most up-to-date data.\n  Usecases:   Real-time Data Synchronization: It enables real-time or near-real-time synchronization of data between different systems, which is crucial for applications like business intelligence, reporting, and data analytics.\n  Reduced Data Transfer: By transmitting only the changes (deltas) rather than the entire dataset, CDC reduces the amount of data transferred, improving efficiency and reducing network and storage costs.\n  Data Auditing and Compliance: CDC can be used for auditing purposes, helping organizations maintain a detailed history of data changes for compliance and security purposes.\n  Okay, So where‚Äôs Event Driven Architecture?! For a brief introduction, Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a design approach where the flow of data and processing is triggered by events. These events can be any significant occurrence or change in state within a system or between systems. CDC plays a crucial role in implementing an Event-Driven Architecture, especially when you need to propagate changes in data across different components of your architecture in a responsive and efficient manner. Here‚Äôs how CDC can be used in an EDA:\n  Capture Data Changes: The first step in implementing CDC within an Event-Driven Architecture is to capture changes in your data sources. This typically involves monitoring databases, file systems, or other data repositories for insert, update, or delete operations on the data.\n  Generate Change Events: Once data changes are captured, CDC systems can generate change events to represent these changes. These events contain information about what changed, where it changed, and when it changed. The format of these events may vary depending on the specific CDC technology being used.\n  Publish Events: The generated change events are then published to an event bus or message broker, which serves as a central communication channel for the architecture. Examples of popular message brokers include Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and AWS SNS/SQS.\n  Event Processing: Consumers within your architecture subscribe to the event bus and process these change events as they occur. The processing can include tasks like updating downstream databases, triggering business logic, updating caches, or notifying users.\n  Decoupled Components: One of the key benefits of an EDA with CDC is decoupling. Components within your architecture are loosely coupled, meaning they don‚Äôt need to be aware of each other‚Äôs existence. They communicate only through events, which allows for flexibility and scalability.\n  Scalability and Resilience: An EDA with CDC can be highly scalable and resilient. You can add more consumers to handle increased event load, and if a consumer fails, the events can be retried or picked up by another consumer.\n  Real-time or Near Real-time: Depending on your requirements, you can achieve real-time or near real-time data propagation and processing, as events are generated and processed as soon as data changes occur.\n  ",
