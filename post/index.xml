      <description>I was exploring the vector database world after my day job when I came across ChromaDB which recently raised a seed funding of 20 mils üí∏. Digging deep into chroma led me to DuckDB as these mfs at Chroma are selling a wrapper on an already matured OLAP DB (DuckDB) with hnswlib. Just for context, hnswlib is a C++/Python library for fast calculation of approximate nearest neighbors (ANN). I&amp;rsquo;ll take more about vector DBs some other day when I&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully use it in my side project.</description>

      <description>I wasted a day of my weekend to take up a course about writing prompt to ChatGPTü§° Now I am writing a blog about what I learnt. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I am doing this, I don&amp;rsquo;t why I completed that course. At this point I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what I am doing with my life. I need some serious soul-searching. I hope this is just another phase for my charater development and nothing more.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;If I had a dollar for every time a techie suggested Redis to use as cache, I&amp;rsquo;ll be a millionaire&amp;rdquo;
So what is Redis and why is it so popular among developers?! By definition, Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store. It serves as a fast, versatile, and persistent database, capable of storing various data types like strings, lists, sets, and more. Redis&amp;rsquo;s speed and simplicity make it an excellent choice for caching, real-time applications, and various use cases requiring rapid data access and manipulation.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Mom! I read yet another random research paper that showed up on my Linkedin feed&amp;rdquo;
So I was scrolling through my Linkedin feed when I came across yet another post by a wanna be tech influencer. Although this time the post was much better than those senseless, out-of-context content with an asthetic selfieü§°. The post recommended few interesting papers to read, so I read one of them and here I summarise it.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;GatsbyJS brings in the power of React and GraphQL and SSR to my website&amp;rdquo;
My dear sweet, innocent dev, do you really need this for a simple blog (which gonna be dead after 3 post)!?ü§°
In my quest for the perfect static site generator, I made a deliberate choice to utilize Hugo instead of modern JavaScript frameworks like Next.js or Gatsby. The decision was based on a multitude of reasons, starting with Hugo&amp;rsquo;s exceptional ‚ö°Ô∏è speed and performance.</description>
